# sampling-assignmnet
This assignment reads a credit card dataset, performs oversampling using RandomOverSampler, creates five different samples using different sampling techniques, and then trains multiple classification models on each of the five samples to compare their performance. The code also calculates the required sample size using the sample size detection formula.

The sampling techniques used are:

Simple Random Sampling
Stratified Sampling
Systematic Sampling
Cluster Sampling
Convenience Sampling
The classification models used are:

Logistic Regression
Naive Bayes
LDA
SVC
KNN
The accuracy of each model on each sample is stored in a table called results_table. The table contains the name of the sample dataset and the accuracy of each model on that dataset.
